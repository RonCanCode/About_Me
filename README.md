# hello-world
Just another repository.

My name is Ron Guglielmone, and I generally do like to learn new things.
However, lately I've been a bit overwhelmed with it.  A few years ago, I 
returned to college as an adult.  Previously, I had worked in the recording 
industry, which was always my childhood dream.  Eventually, illegal downloading 
took enough of a toll on the music industry so that I felt my eventual exit
was inevitable.  So, I packed up my gear and enrolled first at a community 
college, and then later transfered to Stanford.

In a few short weeks, I will conclude my degree program, and I'll officially 
be said to know something about Electrical Engineering.  This GitHub will 
serve as a storage locker for all of my past educational projects, and hopefully 
some new personal projects in the near future.
