# About Me

I began my career as a recording artist and independent musician. After learning the basics of programming and web design, I built a suite of tools to automate online marketing on Myspace.com, Purevolume.com, and several other popular music destinations. This was in the early 2000's, before the term "social media" was being used, and before "spam" had become a dirty word.

I quickly became the #1 unsigned artist on those sites and many others, and sales of my bedroom recordings surpassed ten-thousand units. By this point, I had attracted a lot of industry attention, and began negotiating a bidding war between Warner Music Group, EMI, Sony Music Entertainment, and Universal. On my 18th birthday, I signed a licensing agreement worth over $5M, and officially became a major-label recording artist.

I spent the next several years recording and touring, and eventually opened my own studio in Los Angeles. A few years later, I was given an opportunity to attend Stanford University on a full scholarship. I moved north and earned a B.S. in electrical engineering with a specialization in digital signal processing.

Moving forward, I hope to combine my passion for music and audio with my technical abilities in computer programming, signal processing, and electronics. I'm interested in projects at the intersection of music, professional audio, and computer science, but I am also very interested in investment, finance, and business development.
